Elara, a brave and curious young villager, had eyes that sparkled with wonder. With untamed chestnut hair and a heart full of adventure, she clutched a mysterious map discovered beneath ancient stones—its secrets calling her toward unknown paths beyond the village’s edge.

Shadow, Elara’s steadfast wolf companion, had fur the color of storm clouds and eyes that gleamed with quiet intelligence. Rescued as a pup from a hunter’s trap, he never left her side. Fiercely loyal and silently watchful, Shadow sensed danger before it came and guarded Elara through every step of the unknown.
