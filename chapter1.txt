Deep in the sleepy village of Elderglen, where tales of magic were little more than bedtime whispers, a young villager named Kael stumbled upon an old, dust-covered map hidden beneath a loose floorboard in his grandfather’s cottage. The parchment pulsed faintly in the moonlight, its ink shifting like smoke on water. Marked with strange runes and a crimson X deep within the Whispering Woods—a place long forbidden—Kael felt a sudden pull in his chest. This was no ordinary map. It was a call. A secret waiting to be unearthed, and a destiny quietly awakening.

The moment Elara crossed the threshold into the Whispering Woods, the world shifted. Sunlight dimmed beneath the dense canopy, and the air grew cool and damp, filled with the scent of moss and ancient bark. The trees loomed tall and silent, yet she could almost hear them breathe. Each step stirred leaves that whispered warnings in hushed tones, but Elara pressed on—her heart pounding with fear and wonder. Though utterly alone, she felt watched, not with malice, but with deep, ancient curiosity.
